Hello. I am Sanghyuk Kim, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Boston, working under the guidance of Prof. [Daniel Haehn](https://danielhaehn.com/) in the Machine Psychology Lab. My research bridges medical imaging and systems programming to drive innovative advancements in healthcare diagnostics.

Before my Ph.D., I gained over four years of professional experience in software engineering, specializing in graphics kernel development for Unix/BSD operating systems. This background now underpins my interdisciplinary focus on leveraging low-level systems software for healthcare applications, notably in melanoma detection.

My work explores the intersection of:
- [**Machine Learning with Uncertainty Quantification**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10322): Developing pipelines that enhance diagnostic reliability in medical imaging. Recent work on melanoma detection achieved a 40.5% reduction in misdiagnoses, presented at [IEEE ISBI 2025](https://biomedicalimaging.org/2025/).
- **Medical Imaging and AI for Healthcare**: Leveraging systems programming to improve imaging diagnostics and reduce risks associated with AI hallucinations in critical settings.
- **Kernel-Level Programming**: Creating robust solutions like graphics kernels to improve cross-platform operability and efficiency, now applied to cutting-edge research in healthcare.

Currently, Iâ€™m investigating new methods to combine machine learning with systems programming, aiming to enhance medical imaging reliability and expand the frontiers of healthcare technology.

`I'll be attending IEEE ISBI 2025 (Houston, TX, USA). Feel free to connect!`
